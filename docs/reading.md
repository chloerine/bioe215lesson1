1.  Problems in setwd()

<p>This creates a set path of directories that are almost certainly not the same on the anyone elses machine and can even change over time on your own machine. <br> I assume that RStudio throws an error if the directories do not exist or are not in the same order.</p>

2.  Whats removed when rm(list=ls())

<p>This deleted user made objects, making it difficult to work on multiple projects at once.</p>

3.  Push Pull and commit

<p>Push happens remotely</p>

<p>Pull happens locally</p>

<p>Commit happens locally</p>

4.  Why do diffs work for source code?

<p>They work for source code because there usually isn't many many small binary changes like in the writing of a docx file.</p>

5.  Why is markdown useful for Github repos?

<p>Markdown is useful because it allows for quick text with some markup and you can make a quick website out of it</p>
